# MapReduceInC

MapReduceInC is a student project inspired by a big-data lecture

## Details

It is a C project where i tried to apply the concepts of map reduce paradigm to the application of counting   
how many times all the words in a text file appear.

This works using the #include <pthread.h> library. It has the standard functions of map-reduce: map->shuffle->combine->shuffle->reduce.

## Usage
Compiled as a standard executable, the input file path is hardcoded in the main.c file(you can edit it).
